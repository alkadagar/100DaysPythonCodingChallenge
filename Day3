Understanding data types in Python
C and java requires the data types to be explicity declared which is not the case in python. This flexibility in python makes it easy to use.
# Python code 
x=4
x='four'

# C code
int x = 4

In python, data object has got more information than just the raw value. For example when we define an integer in python x =1000, x is not just a raw integer. A single integer contains 4 pieces of information. 
1. ob_refcnt = reference count that helps python silently handle memory allocation and de-allocation.
2. ob_type = which encodes the type of variable
3. ob_size = specifies the size of following data members
4. ob_digit = contains actual integer value that we expect the python variable to represent.
